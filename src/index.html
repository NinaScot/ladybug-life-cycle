    <!--Hatching Card-->
    <div class="card1 card">
      <p>Ladybugs start off hatching from eggs in the form of larvae.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- append hatching process here -->

    <!-- Eating Aphids Card -->
    <div class="card2 card">
      <p>
        They may eat the leftover fertilized eggs, but will then spend most of
        their eating other bugs, like aphids, scale insects, mites, etc.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Shedding Skin Card -->
    <div class="card3 card">
      <p>
        They also shed their skin many times before becoming a pupae. There, the
        ladybug larvae will mature into adults.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!-- append shedding process here -->

    <!-- Shell Color Change Card -->
    <div class="card4 card">
      <p>
        When they first hatch, their shells are pale orange and fade into bright
        red over time.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!-- append color change here -->

    <!-- Hibernation Card -->
    <div class="card5 card">
      <p>
        In the winter, ladybugs undergo diapause, a method of hibernation,
        during the winter months. Once they find a warm, safe environment, they
        can regulate their body temperature and live off their own energy
        reserves. In fact, ladybugs can survive in diapause for up to nine
        months!
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Spring Card -->
    <div class="card6 card">
      <p>
        In the spring, they exit hibernation and begin searching for a mate to
        start over the process again.
      </p>
