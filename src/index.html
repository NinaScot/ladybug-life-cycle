      <h1>The Life Cycle of a Ladybug</h1>
    </div>
    
    <!--Hatching Card-->
    <div class="Card1">
      <p>Ladybugs start off hatching from eggs in the form of larvae.</p>
      <!-- append hatching process here -->
    
      <!-- Eating Aphids Card -->
    <div class="Card2">
      <p>
        They may eat the leftover fertilized eggs, but will then spend most of their eating other bugs, like aphids, scale insects, mites, etc.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Shedding Skin Card -->
    <div class="Card3">
    <p>
      They also shed their skin many times before becoming a pupae. There, the ladybug larvae will mature into adults.

  </div>
    <!-- append shedding process here -->

    <!-- Shell Color Change Card -->
    <div class="Card4">
      <p>
        When they first hatch, their shells are pale orange and fade into bright red over time.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!-- append color change here -->

    <!-- Hibernation Card -->
    <div class="Card5">
      <p>
        In the winter, ladybugs undergo diapause, a method of hibernation, during the winter months. Once they find a warm, safe environment, they can regulate their body temperature and live off their own energy reserves. In fact, ladybugs can survive in diapause for up to nine months!
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Spring Card -->
    <div class="Card6">
      <p>
        In the spring, they exit hibernation and begin searching for a mate to start over the process again.
      </p>
